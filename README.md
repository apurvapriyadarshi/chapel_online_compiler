# chapel_online_compiler
This is code of the website for compiling CHAPEL code online.


This project is made for my proposal in GSOC 2016 for CHAPEL.


It is an website where you can write chapel code and get the output and errors.

NOTE:- This repo contains only the front end which is not useful till you have configured chapel compiler on your system
and for hosting in your system use WAMP/LAMP as its contains php code .
